# NNDS-HW1

First homework for the course "Neural Networks for Data Science Applications", MSc Data Science, Sapienza Universit√† di Roma 2024-25.

The homework consisted in the implementation in JAX of custom trainable unit-wise activation functions and their usage on a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron model. The trained model is a defect classification on the dataset "Steel Plates Faults", available on the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The dataset has been presented in 1998 with the Paper MetaNet: The Theory of Independent Judges by Dr. Massimo Buscema.

The project was rated with top marks.
